/*
 * Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) Slave EEPROM Simulation
 *
 * This example simulates an I2C EEPROM to demonstrate how to use I2C slave API.
 * This application uses Microchip 24FC256-I/P I2C EEPROM's protocol.
 * You can use I2C example for the master I2C for reading/writing into this
 * simulated EEPROM.
 * After 6 transfers, this application will stop.
 *
 * Instruction:
 * - Flash one board (Intel(R) Quark(TM) development boards) with examples/i2c.
 * - Flash an another board with this application.
 * - connect ground of the first board to the second one.
 * - connect I2C_0 SDA of the first board to I2C_0 SDA of the second one.
 * - connect I2C_0 SCL of the first board to I2C_0 SCL of the second one.
