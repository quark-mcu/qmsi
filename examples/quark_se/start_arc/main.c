 * Start the ARC Running.

 * This example exemplifies how x86 applications may start ARC execution.
 *
 * When ENABLE_RESTORE_CONTEXT feature is enabled, the x86 needs to be ready
 * to resume the ARC after sleep.
 * To achieve this, the x86 core saves its context, and wait for ARC to trigger
 * sleep. After wake-up, the x86 resumes execution where it stopped and
 * resumes the ARC core.
