/*
 * Power SoC Reset app example.
 *
 * This app requires a comparator to wake the SoC from deep sleep. RTC will be
 * explicitly disabled in deep sleep and WDT is disabled in C2. Disabling the
 * RTC is not required but this is done to showcase comparator wake up when in
 * deep sleep mode.
 *
 * On the Intel(R) Quark(TM) SE development platform the comparator pin is
 * located on header J14 pin 20.
 *
 * Wake up from SoC sleep and SoC deep sleep states result in a processor core
 * reset. In order to retain the previous state, this application makes use of
 * General Purpose Register 2.
 *
 * States executed in this example are:
 * SLEEP: Core voltage rail off, peripherals off except Always On.
 *        Wake up from reset vector.
 * DEEP_SLEEP: Core voltage rail off,
 *             1P8V voltage regulator in linear mode,
 *             3P3V voltage regulator in linear mode,
 *             peripherals off except Always On.
 *             Wake up from reset vector.
 * ADVANCED SLEEP: Core voltage rail off.
 *                 1P8V voltage regulator in shutdown mode,
 *                 3P3V voltage regulator in linear mode,
 *                 peripherals off except Always On.
 *                 Wake up from reset vector.
