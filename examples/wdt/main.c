/*
 * Watchdog timer (WDT)
 *
 * This app sets up a watchdog timer to fire every 4.096ms which results in the
 * callback function being invoked and restarts the WDT.
 *
 * If a second timeout occurs and the WDT has not been reloaded, the SoC resets.
 * In this example, the SoC will not reset as the WDT is reloaded in interrupt
 * callback triggered at every timeout.
 *
 * Note: on Intel(R) Quark(TM) SE, the WDT will automatically pause if the
 * x86 core is in the C2 state. As a result the WDT will not fire or generate
 * interrupts. If using the sensor subsystem, it is advised to use one of the
 * supplied timers to act as a watchdog.
