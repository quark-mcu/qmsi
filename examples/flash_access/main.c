 * Flash Access
 *
 * This app demonstrates the use of the flash controller.

 * The flash controller segments its memory into pages of 2KB in size
 * (multiples of 0x800). Writes don't cross over to other pages.
 *
 * The Intel(R) Quark(TM) D2000 SoC has a single flash controller.
 *
 * Controller 0:
 * |  Component                 | Size          | System start address
 * |  System ROM		| 8KB	 	| 0x00000000
 * |  System Flash		| 32KB		| 0x00180000
 * |  Data region		| 4KB		| 0x00200000
 *
 * The Intel(R) Quark(TM) SE SoC has 2 flash controllers.
 *
 * Controller 0:
 * |  Component                 | Size          | System start address
